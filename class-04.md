# Links
Links are the defining feature of the web because they allow you to move from one web page to another — enabling the very idea of browsing or surfing.

## Creating Links
Links are created using the `<a>` element. Users can click on anything
between the opening `<a>` tag and the closing `</a>` tag. You specify
which page you want to link to using the href attribute.

Example on Links to other sites

`<a href="www.google.com">Google</a>`

Example on Links to other pages
`<a href="aboutus.html">About us</a>`

# Layouts

## Controlling the Position of Elements

CSS allows you to control the layout of a page: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute positioning. You specify the positioning scheme using the position property in CSS. You can also float elements using the float property.

- Normal flow
- Relative Positioning
- Absolute positioning
- Fixed Positioning
- Floating Elements

# Funtions, Methods, and objects

## FUNCTIONS

Functions are group of statements to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function.

### Declaring a function

syntax

```
function name(parameter1, parameter2) {
  // code to be executed
}
```

### Calling a function

to call a function in JavaScript ypu only have to type the funtion name and parentheses and a semicolon
`name();`


# 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

## How does pair programming work?

pair programming involves two roles: 
- the Driver 
 The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code.
- the Navigator
The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. 

## Why pair program?

Pair programming touches on all four skills Listening, Speaking,  Reading, and Writing: developers explain out loud what the code should do, listen to others’ guidance, read code that others have written, and write code themselves.


1. Greater efficiency
two programmers may come to a solution faster than one programmer on their own. Also, when the pair is stuck, both programmers can research the problem and reach a solution faster.

2. Engaged collaboration
When two programmers focus on the same code, the experience is more engaging and both programmers are more focused than if they were working alone.
Another important aspect of learning to program is knowing when to ask for help. 

3. Learning from fellow students
Everyone has a different approach to problem solving; working with a teammate can expose developers to techniques they otherwise would not have thought of.


4. Social skills
Pair programming is great for improving social skills. When working with someone who has a different coding style, communication is key. This can become more difficult when two programmers have different personalities.


5. Job interview readiness
A common step in many interview processes involves pair programming between a current employee and an applicant, either in person or through a shared screen. They will carry out exercises together, such as code challenges, building a project or feature, or debugging an existing code base.


6. Work environment readiness
Many companies that utilize pair programing expect to train fresh hires from CS-degree programs on how they operate to actually deliver a product.
