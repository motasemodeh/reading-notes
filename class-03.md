# Lists in HTML

in order to creatr a list in HTML There're three types of lists in HTML

- Ordered lists

- Unordered lists

- Definition lists


## Ordered Lists

they are lists where each item in the list is numbered. Ordered lists use numbers.

```
<ol>
<li>Chop potatoes into quarters</li>
<li>Simmer in salted water for 15-20
minutes until tender</li>
<li>Heat milk, butter and nutmeg</li>
<li>Drain potatoes and mash</li>
<li>Mix in the milk mixture</li>
</ol>
```

## Unordered lists

are lists that begin with a bullet point.

```
<ul>
<li>1kg King Edward potatoes</li>
<li>100ml milk</li>
<li>50g salted butter</li>
<li>Freshly grated nutmeg</li>
<li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
</ul>
```

## Definition lists

are made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms. we create them using `<dl>`

# Boxes

## Box Dimentions
width, hieght
By default a box is sized just big enough to hold its contents. To set your own dimensions for a box you can use the height and width properties.

we have two properties to control the Box size width and hieght

## Limiting Width

Some page designs expand and shrink to fit the size of the user's screen. In such designs, the min-width property specifies the smallest size a box can be
displayed at when the browser window is narrow, and the max-width property indicates the maximum width a box can stretch to when the browser window is wide.

## Limiting Height

In the same way that you might want to limit the width of a box on a page, you may also want to limit the height of it. This is achieved using the min-height and max-height properties.

## Overflowing Content

overflow property in CSS has two values

- hidden
- scroll

### hidden
This property simply hides any extra content that does not fit in the box.
### scroll
This property adds a scrollbar to the box so that users can scroll to see the missing content.

# Basic JavaScript Instructions

## ARRAYS

An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values.

when we create arrays we need to specify the number of values it will holds

### Creating Arrays

```
var colors;
colors = [values];
```

# IF ... ELSE Statements

we use if else statements to check conditions if the first code is true it will be excuted and if false the second code wil be excuted instead.

```
if( age > 18 ) {
document.write(Qualifies for driving);
}
```

## Switch statement

A switch statement starts with a variable called the switch value. Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value.

```switch (expression) {
   case condition 1: statement(s)
   break;
   
   case condition 2: statement(s)
   break;
   ...
   
   case condition n: statement(s)
   break;
   
   default: statement(s)
}
```

## TRUTHY & FALSY VALUES

Due to type coercion, every value in JavaScript can be treated as if it were true or false; and this has some interesting side effects.

### Falsy values
treated as if they are false.

|  value 	|   description	|
|---	|---	|
|   var highScore = false;	|   the traditional value is false	|  
|   var highScore = 0;	|   the number zero	|  
|   var highScore = '';	|   NAN	|
|   var highScore;	|   VARIABLE WITH NO VALUE	|   	

### Truthy values
are treated as if they are true.
