# Images
The `<img>` tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page.

Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are linked to web pages. The `<img>` tag creates a holding space for the referenced image.

## Storing Images on Your Site

If you are building a site from scratch, it is good practice to create a folder for all of the images the site uses.

## Adding Images

`<img src="img/cat.jpg" alt="Image of a cat" title="Image of a cat" />`

- src - Specifies the path to the image
- alt - Specifies an alternate text for the image, if the image for some reason cannot be displayed

- title - the title attribute with the `<img>` element to provide additional information about the image.
