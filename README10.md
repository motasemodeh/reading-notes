# how computers work

computers are everywhere in cars in home even in our puckets

## What Makes a Computer, a Computer?

It takes input and stores them then process them then out put these these data

## Binary and Data
Computers use binary - the digits 0 and 1 - to store data. A binary digit, or bit , is the smallest unit of data in computing. It is represented by a 0 or a 1. Binary numbers are made up of binary digits (bits), eg the binary number 1001.

## Circuits and Logic
Computer uses millions of teeny of teeny electronic components which come together to form Circuits

Computers often chain logic gates together use logic gates to create electronic circuits, by taking the output from one gate and using it as the input to another gate. We call that a logic circuit.

## CPU, Memory, Input & Output
Computers are input devices they take data from the outside world and convert them into binary information 
Cpu where all the calculations are done
And the data will be stored in memory the will be represented add output


## Hardware and Software

Computer hardware is any physical device used in or with your machine, whereas software is a collection of codes installed onto your computer’s hard drive. For instance, the computer monitor you’re currently using to read this text and the mouse you’re using to navigate this web page is computer hardware.
