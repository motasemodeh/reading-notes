# Basic usage of canvas

 `<canvas>` HTML element  looks like the `<img>` element, with the only clear difference being that it doesn't have the src and alt attributes. Indeed, the `<canvas>` element has only two attributes, width and height. These are both optional and can also be set using DOM properties. When no width and height attributes are specified, the canvas will initially be 300 pixels wide and 150 pixels high. The element can be sized arbitrarily by CSS, but during rendering the image is scaled to fit its layout size: if the CSS sizing doesn't respect the ratio of the initial canvas, it will appear distorted.

 ## Fallback content

 The `<canvas>` element differs from an `<img>` tag in that, like for `<video>`, `<audio>`, or `<picture>` elements, it is easy to define some fallback content, to be displayed in older browsers not supporting it, like versions of Internet Explorer earlier than version 9 or textual browsers. You should always provide fallback content to be displayed by those browsers.

 # Drawing shapes with canvas

## The grid
Before we can start drawing, we need to talk about the canvas grid or coordinate space. Our HTML skeleton from the previous page had a canvas element 150 pixels wide and 150 pixels high. To the right, you see this canvas with the default grid overlayed. Normally 1 unit in the grid corresponds to 1 pixel on the canvas. The origin of this grid is positioned in the top left corner at coordinate (0,0). All elements are placed relative to this origin. So the position of the top left corner of the blue square becomes x pixels from the left and y pixels from the top, at coordinate (x,y). Later in this tutorial we'll see how we can translate the origin to a different position, rotate the grid and even scale it, but for now we'll stick to the default.


## Drawing rectangles

There are three functions that draw rectangles on the canvas:
`fillRect(x, y, width, height)`
Draws a filled rectangle.
`strokeRect(x, y, width, height)`
Draws a rectangular outline.
`clearRect(x, y, width, height)`
Clears the specified rectangular area, making it fully transparent.

## Drawing text

The canvas rendering context provides two methods to render text:

`fillText(text, x, y [, maxWidth])`
Fills a given text at the given (x,y) position. Optionally with a maximum width to draw.
`strokeText(text, x, y [, maxWidth])`
Strokes a given text at the given (x,y) position. Optionally with a maximum width to draw.
