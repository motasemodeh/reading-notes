# JavaScript: Intro + Scripts and functions
JavaScript can be used in browsers to make websites more interactive,
interesting, and user-friendly.

### What do you need to learn JavaScript?

Understanding the concepts and the terms of JavaScript
programmers

Learning the language itself, learning how to construct its code

learning how it is applied by looking at examples of how JavaScript is commonly used in websites today.

### Java Script makes web pages interactive

You can make your web page more interactive by accessing and modifying the content and markup of the web page

### What can we do with JavaScript?

#### Slideshows
Slideshows can display a number of different images (or other HTML content) within the same space on a given page.

#### FORMS

Validating forms (checking whether they have been filled in correctly) is important when information is supplied by users.

#### RELOAD PART OF PAGE

Reload small portion of a page and not the content of an entire web page, it will feel like it is faster to load and more like an application.

#### FILTERING DATA

If you have a lot of information to display on a page, you can help users find information they need by providing filters.




## Scripts

A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal. You could compare scripts to RECIPES, HANDBOOKS, and MANUALS

To write a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it.

Start with the big picture of what you want to achieve, and break that down into smaller steps.

•	DEFINE THE GOAL
•	DESIGN THE SCRIPT
•	CODE EACH STEP


Designing the script

You can design your script by drawing a flowchart



SKETCHING OUT THE TASKS IN A FLOWCHART
Often scripts will need to perform different tasks in different situations.
You can use flowcharts to work out how the tasks fit together.
The flowcharts show the paths between each step.



### EXPRESSIONS

there are two types of expressions.

EXPRESSIONS to assign a value to a variable

`var color = 'beige';`

EXPRESSIONS to use two or more values to return a value


`var area = 3 * 2;`



### OPERATORS

We use perators in expressions they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values.

#### ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS
To assign a value to a variable
`color = 'beige';`

#### ARITHMETIC OPERATORS
Perform basic math
`area = 3 * 2;`

#### LOGICAL OPERATORS
Combine expressions and return true or fa 1 se
`buy= (5 > 3) && (2 < 4);`


#### COMPARISON OPERATORS
Compare two values and return true or fa 1 se
`buy = 3 > 5;`



#### String operators
To combine two Strings
`greeting= 'Hi 1 + 'Molly';`



## WHAT IS A FUNCTION?

Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).

we have the function keyword and the function name followed by parentheses
then the code block in curly braces


### Function Syntax in JavaScript
```function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
  // code to be executed
}
```

To declare a function there have to be the function keyword and the function name followed by parentheses then the code block in curly braces
