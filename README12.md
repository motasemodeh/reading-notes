# Comparison and logical operators

## Comparison Operators
Comparison operators are used to return a value of true or false.
## Logical operators
allow you to compare the result of more than one comparison operator.


|  Operator 	|   Description	|  Example 	|
|---	|---	|---	|
|   `&&`	|  and 	|  (x < 10 && y > 1) is true   | 
|  `||` 	|  or 	|  (x == 5 || y == 5) is false   | 
|   `!`	 |  not 	|  !(x == y) is true   | 


### logical AND 
logical AND operator (&&) for a set of operands is true if and only if all of its operands are true.

### logical OR 
The logical OR operator (||) returns the Boolean value true if either or both operands is true and returns false otherwise.

### logical NOT
The logical NOT (!) operator (logical complement, negation) takes truth to falsity and vice versa.


## LOOP

Loops check conditions if they are true it will run again until the value is false


## for 
for loops through a block of code a number of times
for loop has the following syntax
for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
  // code block to be executed
}

## while
while loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true

while loop has the following syntax
while (condition) {
  // code block to be executed
}
