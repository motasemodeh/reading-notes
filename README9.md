#JavaScript

### HTML ONLY
Starting with the HTML layer allows you to focus on the most important thing about your site: its content. Being plain HTML, this layer should work on all kinds of devices, be accessible to all users, and load quite quickly on slow connections.

### HTML+CSS
Adding the CSS rules in a separate file keeps rules regarding how the page looks away from the content itself. You can use the same style sheet with all of your site, making your sites faster to load and easier to maintain. Or you can use different style sheets with the same content to create different views of the same data.

### HTML+CSS+JAVASCRIPT
The JavaScript is added last and enhances the usability of the page or the experience of interacting with the site. Keeping it separate means
that the page still works if the user cannot load or run the JavaScript. You can also reuse the code on several pages (making the site faster to load and easier to maintain).

### How to use objects and Methods

`Document.write(‘’);`

This is called method of an object
The word document is an object that represents the web page

The dot .

It’s called member operator

`write('');`
this is the method and inside the parentheses we add parameters.


## STATEMENTS

A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one.
Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement. Statements should end with a semicolon.

This is a javascript statement

`var today= new Date();`


## COMMENTS

You should write comments to explain what your code does. They help make your code easier to read and understand. This can help you and others who read your code.

This how comments look like in javascript

```/* This script displays a greeting to the user based upon the current time.
It is an example from JavaScript & jQuery book */
```


`// Display the appropriate greeting based on the current time`



## Variables

A script will have to temporarily store the bits of information it
needs to do its job. It can store this data in variables.

we use variables to "remember" the values for width and height. (This also illustrates how a scrip( contains very explicit instructions about
exactly what you want the computer to do.) You can compare variables to short-term memory, because once you leave the page, the browser will
forget any information it holds.
